#  Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

This is a **React-based pathfinding algorithm visualizer** that demonstrates how various algorithms work in real-time. You can interactively place a **Start** node, **End** node, build **walls**, generate **random mazes**, and visualize paths using algorithms like **A\***, **Dijkstra's**, **BFS**, and **DFS**.

## âœ¨ Features

-  **Visualize Popular Algorithms**:
  - A* (A-Star)
  - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
-  Drag & drop **Start** and **End** nodes
-  Click and drag to build **walls/obstacles**
-  **Random Maze Generator**
-  Real-time **Step-by-step visualization** 
-  Set the **speed** as per your preference. 
-  **Reset Board** button to clear everything
-  Toggle between algorithms without refreshing
